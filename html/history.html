            It started when she was just a child, Ingrid had found comfort in the warm embrace of a cup of tea after school.
            As well as her tradition of an afternoon tea every Sunday afternon hosted at the home of her Dutch grandmother.
            This tradition carried into Ingrid's marriage,where she and her husband, Patrick would enjoy a Sunday afternoon tea on their wedding china.
            This was no longer at this point a simple tradition but a staple to every weekend of rest and restoration.
            Over the course of their marriage, Ingrid and Patrick Byker had visited several tea houses across the country whenever they found themselves on a road trip.
            One day while she was praying, Ingrid had sensed that God was asking her to find her passion. 
            Pondering over the question, Ingrid realized that, that which she had enjoyed- tea,fine china, silver, white table cloths, and elegance- 
            she had dismissed as frivolity. God had began to reveal to Ingrid that these were not just nostalgic facinations of times simpler and more at ease, but that he had actually created her to enjoy these things. 
            This discovery, led her to want to share these passions with others.
